"""
Rabbitmq is needed to be installed for this script to work.
This script is part of messaging algorithm works together
with receiver.py. Api endpoints that take too long time to
process will send a request to process data to the receiver
with some message id. Sender is used to generate this id
and send the message with this id and some body which receiver
should understand.Once receiver is done processing data
it will send back the response using the message id.

Receiver is used to add, update or remove yang modules.
This process take a long time depending on the number
of the yang modules. This script is also used to automatically
add or update new IETF and Openconfig modules.
